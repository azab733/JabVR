# JabVR

Jab VR is a mixed reality boxing game for visionOS that I am making for my final project. Jab
VR is built for the upcoming Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset. Its purpose is to
utilize the features and capablities of the Apple Vision Pro, while also being a fun game for
users of the headset to play.
